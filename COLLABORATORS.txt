Name: Aditya Duggirala
I spent 7 hours and 55 minutes on this project 
(Total of 2 hours and 20 mins on Part 1: 30 mins on Prob. 1, 15 mins on Prob. 2, and 1 hrs on Prob 3, 25 mins on Prob 4, and 10 mins on Prob 5)
(Total of 3 hours mins on Part 2: 1 hr and 25 mins hour on Histogram,  1 hr and 35 mins on Count of White and Black Pixels)
(Total of 5 mins on Part 3)
(Total amount of time on PDF) 2 hours and 30 mins

I sought help from Kelly and Gabe 

Kelly helped me with the long run time and Convergence warnings of part one by explaining the meaning of this warning 

Gabe and Kelly (I met Kelly twice )gave me some ideas of what Part 2 is about and what I can do to finish it

The Project One PDF document provided many links to the libraries I used. However, I had to find extra functions using the numpy library for Part 2. They're the histogram, astype function used for the histogram and counting black and white pixels. I also looked up how to edit files to add the columns for the extra features.
